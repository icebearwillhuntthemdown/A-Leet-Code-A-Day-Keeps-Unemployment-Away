# Hash Table

A data structure consists of key and value and uses the key instead of index. The key input goes into a 'Hash function' and the result becomes the memory address to access the value. Many languages have their own built in hash table, for example, maps in Java, object in JavaScript, and dictionaries in Python.  

##### What does 'Hash' mean?
> The term "hash" comes by way of analogy with its non-technical meaning, to "chop and mix". Indeed, typical hash functions, like the mod operation, "chop" the input domain into many sub-domains that get "mixed" into the output range to improve the uniformity of the key distribution.
