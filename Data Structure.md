# Data Structure

Data structure is a way to organise data so that we can easily access to them. Each data structure is specialised for its own thing, just like a backpack is for books, a fridge is for food, and a toolbox is for tools. Each one has their tradeoffs, some are good at certain operations and others are good at other operations. 

### Why care Data Structure?
RAM(Random Access Memory)
volatile


Insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, sorting, accessing
*traversal* : 순회 (to traverse : to move or travel through an area)

## Array 
Data is stored in contiguous memory that is in order.
* Static array : fixed length, like array in java
* Dynamic array : resizable, like array list in java

+) String questions are often array questions. After all, a string is an array of characters and turning it into array and treat it as an array is a good approach.
